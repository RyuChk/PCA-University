Adventage of linked list;
    - Dynamic size (Array size is fixed and data need to be similar type [stack type])
    - Inserting element between linked list is cheaper than array because when Inserting data to array the array need to be shifted.

Dis-Adventage of linked list
    - Ramdon access is not allow this cuase by using class 
    - To add new data it need to run through all node make it slower

Type of linkedList
    - singly linked list --> Normal linked list
        CLASS Note(data):
            self.Next = none
            self.data = data

    - doubly linked list --> is linked list which have privirous location in it 
        CLASS Note(data)
            self.Next = none
            self.pre = none --> What added
            self.data = data
    
    - circular linked list --> last node have next element as head of stack
        CLASS Node(data)
            self.Next = (node head) --> If it is the last element
            self.data = data 

    - doubly circular linked list --> Combind of circular and doubly linked list'
        CLASS Note(data)
            self.Next = (node head) --> If it is last element
            self.pre = none --> What added from doubly linked list
            self.data = data
