What is recursion?
    - recursion(recursive) is method which function will called it self until it reach a base case or end cases.

What is stack overflow?
    - A Phenomenom which happened when base case is not reachble or not defined.

Direct and In-direct recursion?
    Direct --> Called same function or itself
    Indirect --> Called other fucntion to perform recursive

    // An example of direct recursion
        void directRecFun()
        {
            // Some code....

            directRecFun();

            // Some code...
        }

        // An example of indirect recursion
        void indirectRecFun1()
        {
            // Some code...

            indirectRecFun2();

            // Some code...
        }
        void indirectRecFun2()
        {
            // Some code...

            indirectRecFun1();

            // Some code...
        }

Tailed and non-tailed recursion
