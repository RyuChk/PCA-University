Differenct with array
    Stack
     - As linear data structure we cannot access data by it location but need to take each index out of the Top
     - Stack can have different type of data
     - OPERATION is Push (adding / insertion) and Pop (delete or take out latest / top index out of stack)
     - Dynamic Size ( can be increase or decrese )
     - Because of linear data structure we only can do linear search

    Array
     - Way to organize and keep the same of data together which data keep belong to it indexes. Array[index] --> access by it location/index
     - Inserting and delete can be done by access it index
     - Array has fixed size
     - Flexible with linear and bineary search.
